# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Getting Started

1. Download `.env` File from [this link](https://share.1password.com/s#p9pHwDc16pJFpbSrjDYKILKM49qjKlWcl0qRUJOotHY)

2. In the root directory, please run 

```
npm install (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`)
```

3. Run 

```
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
